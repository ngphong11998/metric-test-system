Build a Metric tracking system that support different Units.
1. We want to track the following metrics:
  - Distance (Meter, centimeter, inch, feet, yard)
  - Temperature (°C, °F, °K)
2. User should be able to add new metric with: Date, Value, Unit
3. User should be able get a List of all Metrics base on the type ( Distance / Temperature)
4. User should be able to get data to draw a chart, which take the latest metric insert for a day, based on the type and specific time period (1 Month, 2 Month)
5. If User specific a unit when calling the above APIs, it should also convert the value for them.
